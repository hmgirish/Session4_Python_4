1.2 Write a function filter_long_words() that takes a list of words and an integer n and returns
the list of words that are longer than n.

Solution:

def filter_long_words(words_list, l):
    return (word for word in words_list if len(word) >= l)

def main():
    words = input("Enter words, separated by spaces: ").split()
    l = int(input("Minimum length of words to display: "))
    print("Words longer than {} are {}.".format(l, ', '.join(filter_long_words(words, l))))
