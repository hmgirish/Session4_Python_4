2.1 Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers
representing the lengths of the corresponding words.

Hint: If a list [ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4]

Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.

Solution:

def words_to_length_map(words_list):
    words_lengths = []
    for i in range(len(words_list)):
        words_lengths.append(len(words_list[i]))
    return words_lengths
    
def main():
    words_list = input("Enter words, separated by spaces: ").split()
    print("List of words length of {} are {}.".format(words_list, ''.join(str(words_to_length_map(words_list)))))
    
main()
